# Nassau-County-Home-Market-Value-Predictor
This project uses sci-kit's Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict the value of homes in Nassau County. The data was scraped, cleaned, and wrangled from start to finish by me using BS4, pandas and numpy. Every village/CDP was scraped unless there was no listings. The data also exlcuded homes over $2,000,000.
